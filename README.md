Hello, this is my my Front end focused Next.js Ecommerce store. In the project I wanted to display my frontend skills and understanding of the Next.js framework, as well as my understanding of vanila CSS. I used sanity.io as my backend to store and modify my products used on the website. This project for me was a huge learning process and really tested my skills when it came down to javascript logic, Next.js state management, and making mobile responsive CSS. Even now looking back, I've already seen ways in which I could improve my code. I was and still am activily learning while completing this project so I know some code isnt perfect, but my goal was to challenge myself and get the project completeted by any means necessary and with very little outside help. No tutorials or assitances from peers, just google to help solve bugs and errors.
